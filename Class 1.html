  <h1>Hawksbills Sea Turtle</h1>

  <h3> What are they? </h3>
  <p> You've probably seen it, but don't recognize them. Remember the turtle Crush from Nemo?
    His species of turtles is called a Hawksbills Sea Turtle due to their narrow shapped bill. The reasons
    for why these species are endangered is because of their shell. The colour and pattern of their shell
    resembles a tortoiesshell which is highly sold for.

  <h3>Why are they in danger?</h3>
  <p> An essential danger to the ocean turtles is their accidental catch in fishing gear which can
    bring about suffocating or make wounds that lead passing or weakness (for instance, gulping snares or flipper trap).
    Hawksbill tortoise shell is often collected and carved into hair clips, combs, jewelry, and other trinkets, while
    whole
    turtles are often harvested and stuffed, all of which can then be sold in the illegal wildlife trade. Hawksbill eggs
    are dug
    up and consumed by coastal community members, or sold for consumption in nearby urban centers. Hawksbill meat is
    still
    consumed in many countries, although it is often considered less of a delicacy than the meat of other sea turtle
    species.

  <h3> How we can help</h3>
  <p> It takes time for the population of Hawksbills Sea Turtles to repopulate. In the mean time we can help by doing
    simple things that
    can make an impact to the enviorment. Such as, respecting habitats leaving them as you came, reducing your waste,
    either by cutting them
    into smaller or finding a location that would deal with it for you. As well as remebering to properly dispose of
    your trash cause 70% of
    our debris sinks into the ocean's ecosystem, 15% floats, and 15% lands on our beaches.
